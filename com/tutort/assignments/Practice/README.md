# Object-Oriented Programming Practice in Java

This repository contains code examples you've written to explore and practice core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
concepts in Java.

What You'll Find:

Classes: Implementations of various classes representing real-world entities with attributes (properties) and methods (
behaviors).
Objects: Instances of classes that encapsulate data and provide access to functionalities.
Inheritance: Examples of extending existing classes to create specialized subclasses that inherit properties and
behaviors.
Polymorphism: Demonstrations of how objects of different classes can respond differently to the same method call.
Encapsulation: Code practices that restrict direct access to an object's internal state, promoting data integrity.
Abstraction: Techniques that focus on the essential functionalities of objects, hiding implementation details.
Getting Started:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from the
official Oracle website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
IDE Setup: Choose a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your preference, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or
NetBeans. These IDEs provide features that make Java development more efficient.
Clone or Download: Clone this repository using Git or download the ZIP archive.
Compile and Run: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal/command prompt. Compile the Java source files using
the javac command (e.g., javac *.java). Then, execute your programs using the java command followed by the class name (
e.g., java MyMainClass).
